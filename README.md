This guide will walk you through the process of pulling a Git repository to your local server using a client that utilizes the cURL library. Please note that this guide assumes you have a basic understanding of the command line and Git.

## Requrement 
To complete this guide, you will need the following:

+ A local server running on your machine (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
+ Git installed on your machine.
+ A client that utilizes the cURL library for making HTTP requests (e.g., cURL, Postman).

## Steps
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your local server.

2. Create a new directory for your project by running the following command:
```
mkdir my-project
```

3. Navigate into the new directory by running the following command:
```
cd my-project
```
4. Initialize a new Git repository in the directory by running the following command:

```
git init
```

5. Use your cURL client to make an HTTP request to the remote Git repository's clone URL. For example, if the repository's clone URL is https://github.com/username/repo.git, you can use the following command:
```
curl https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

6. You will be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials.

Once you have successfully authenticated with the remote Git repository, you can clone it to your local server by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git 
```

This will clone the repository to your current directory (the my-project directory you created earlier).

You can now start working with the project files on your local server.
Note: If you are using HTTPS and want to test with SSL protocol, you may need to set the following options in your cURL client:

```
CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST => 2,
CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER => 2,
```

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you should now have successfully pulled a Git repository to your local server using a client that utilizes the cURL library. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the documentation for your cURL client or Git.
